            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome to the NASA RECOVER 2.0 NDVI Baseline web mapping application. The
              purpose of this application is to allow users to get a general overview of an area's NDVI statistics 
              over the past decade (2013 - 2022). These statistics include mean, median, maximum, standard deviation, 
              and 95% confidence interval upper- and lower-bounds. This app serves as a supplement to the <a href="">
              NDVI Baseline tutorial document.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              Simply click anywhere in the contiguous Western United States to generate a table of NDVI baseline statistics
              values at that specific latitude and longitude. A map pop-up containing the latitude, longitude, and table will 
              appear, as well as a cyan point graphic where you clicked. The pop-up can be docked to the top-right corner of 
              the map. The NDVI Mean layer is turned on by default, but all summary statistics image layers can be toggled on and 
              off in the layer list widget. 
            </p>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                These summary statistics layers were built by Idaho State University's GIS Training and Research Center staff. Using 
                Google Earth Engine, Landsat 8 OLI NDVI imagery was created and downloaded for WRS Paths 31-48 and Rows 26-38 (175 unique 
                path/row combinations). Using ArcGIS Pro, the resulting imagery was scaled by a factor of 10,000 and mosaicked. From this multidimensional 
                mosaic dataset, summary statistics imagery layers were derived and published. For more information, please visit the <a
